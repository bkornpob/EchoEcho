# EchoEcho

EchoEcho is the game in which you would experience the darkness from being blind. In order to survive, you have only your voice.

This game is a project in Global Game Jam 2017, under the theme "waves."
Many thanks to my team, Ohio University Game Developer Association, Ohio University (OUGDA), The Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) Lab at Ohio University.

Note that these builds are not the one released in GGJ2017. But, they are my released versions.

EchoEcho_1.0.0a.unitypackage was built under Unity 5.5.

EchoEcho_WindowsBuild.zip was built for Windows. Actually, it is version 1.2.0.
